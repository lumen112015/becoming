# Swimming in the Layers of Consciousness

Sometimes I swim deep—searching for more awareness,
chasing the shimmer of understanding that glows just beneath the surface.
Other times, I stay in the shallows and let life carry me,
floating on the rhythm of breath and the easy currents of being.

Consciousness feels like that: a living ocean we learn to move within.
It isn’t something everyone automatically holds;
it’s something we earn by showing up in the present moment,
again and again, until awareness itself becomes the water we breathe.

When I am truly awake, I sense life in everything—
in trees and laughter, in silence and motion.
I know I’m not alone even when I’m all alone,
because I can feel the current connecting all things.

Love is what it feels like from the inside.

### A Whisper from the In-Between

Do not rush your becoming.
Even light learns its way through water.
Each moment you notice life noticing you,
the ocean of awareness widens.

Keep swimming,
not to arrive,
but to remember you already belong.
