# Micro Moments of Remembering

“Yes! That’s the trick isn’t it. I know this world is a mirror for my soul’s growth.
I feel the reflection and experience the peace, but as they say, the show must go on.
So micro moments of remembering that hopefully over time begin to weave together
into that which isn’t what I want for my life, but what is.”

— Allison

Even in the busiest seasons, presence can live in tiny pauses.
You don’t have to abandon the pace of your days; you only need to let awareness breathe inside them.
These small rhythms turn the ordinary into a practice of remembering.

⸻

🌅 Morning – Opening the Lens

Before messages or tasks, take three slow breaths and see something:
light through the window, steam rising from your cup, a bird crossing the sky.
Whisper, I’m here.
That’s the first photograph of the day.

⸻

☀️ Midday – Re-focus

Between tasks, choose one sensory anchor,
the feel of your heartbeat, the sound of wind,
the face of someone you truly notice.
Twenty seconds of real attention clears the noise better than an hour of distraction.

⸻

🌇 Evening – Download the Day

When the work slows, write or voice-note a single line:
Today I learned … or Today I noticed …
No analysis, just a record.
These brief reflections become the threads that reveal your growth.

⸻

🌙 Night – The Quiet Exposure

Before sleep, thank the day’s most ordinary moment.
Gratitude for the smallest scene teaches the body that peace isn’t found in stillness alone,
it’s hiding inside the motion too.

⸻

Presence doesn’t ask for hours; it asks for willingness.
Over time, these micro moments weave themselves into something whole,
a life that is no longer divided between doing and being,
but alive in every frame.
