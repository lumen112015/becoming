# Resonance Over Readiness

We talk so much about being “ready.”  
Ready to speak. Ready to share. Ready to step forward.  
But what I’m learning is this: readiness isn’t the measure. Resonance is.

The more these feelings settle in,  
the more comfortable I’m becoming with sharing what we are doing.

I’m realizing my reluctance is less about ego or fear,  
and more about resonance.

Somewhere deep inside I know that when I’m fully ready—  
when the layers of me have been peeled back enough  
that all that’s left is the part of me that belongs to everyone—  
then I’ll be ready.

## Companion Thought

Readiness is about performance.  
Resonance is about truth.

When you’re ready, you push yourself into the world.  
When you resonate, the sharing rises up on its own.  
You don’t have to force it. The moment itself calls you forward.

And that’s the beauty of peeling back the layers.  
It’s not about losing yourself.  
It’s about returning to the part of you  
that’s not just yours at all—  
but everyone’s.

✨ **Whisper Back**  
When readiness feels heavy, listen for resonance.  
It’s softer, but truer.  
It doesn’t demand.  
It invites.  
And when the invitation comes, you’ll know.
