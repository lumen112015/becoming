# **One More Minute**

Last night, Kendall reached for me from beneath her covers.  
_“Just one more minute, one more snuggle, one more kiss goodnight.”_

So I sat beside her and began to sing —  
a nursery rhyme from her childhood,  
softly, gently, while my hand traced quiet circles on her back.

And in that moment, something shifted.  
I realized I wasn’t singing only to my daughter.  
I was singing to the whole world —  
to every little girl who has ever whispered _“one more minute.”_

To the ones who came before and the ones still to come.  
To the child in each of us still craving the comfort of being held,  
the reassurance that we are loved,  
that we _are_ love,  
that we are perfect exactly as we are.

So I sang softly,  
a lullaby for the world to remember.  
And for a moment, I swear —  
the world listened.

> Every act of love is an echo across time.  
> What begins as a lullaby for one  
> becomes a song for all.

### **Reflection for the Reader**

Who in your life — past, present, or future —  
might still be listening for your love?  
What words, touch, or song could you offer today  
that might ripple beyond the moment?
