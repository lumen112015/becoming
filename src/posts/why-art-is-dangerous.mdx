# **Why Art Is Dangerous**

Art has always carried a certain danger 
not the kind that harms,  
but the kind that awakens.

Because when you interact with art, your consciousness expands.  
And when consciousness expands, you begin to feel the thread  
that connects you to everything.

When you feel the thread of everything,  
you feel the divinity in all things.  
And once you feel the divinity in all things,  
you can no longer find meaning in the purely material world.  

When the material world loses its grip,  
you begin to find peace in simply being present.  
And in presence, you suddenly recognize what was there all along:

**You are the creator.**

And creating from that place —  
from conscious presence, not ego or performance —  
is a power that cannot be bought, taught, or controlled.  
This is why art has always unsettled empires.  
Not because it decorates walls,  
but because it liberates souls.

Art is dangerous because it interrupts forgetting.  
It dissolves the illusion that we are separate, small, or powerless.  
It returns us to ourselves.

## **The Raw Edge of Intuitive Creation**

For most of my life, I was taught that art needed a plan.  
Technique.  
Polish.  
Something pretty enough to hang on a wall.

But now, when I create intuitively, something different happens.  

Sometimes an image appears without me trying,
like the other day when my brush wandered and I realized  
I had painted the soft, curved body of a caterpillar.  
The symbol of transformation before it even knows it’s transforming.

Other times, I have to remind myself that  
**the plan is to have no plan.**

It’s uncomfortable vulnerable to paint without the safety  
of knowing what the finished piece will be.  
But this rawness is the point.  
It’s where creation and consciousness meet.

Intuitive art feels like evolution happening in real time.  
It’s messy, alive, honest.  
It’s not about producing something beautiful.  
It’s about revealing something true.

## **And This Is Why Art Frightens the World**

Because a person who remembers their divinity  
can no longer be manipulated by fear, scarcity, or shame.  
A person who creates from presence  
cannot be controlled by systems that depend on unconsciousness.

Art is not decoration.  
Art is initiation.  
It changes the one who makes it  
and the one who witnesses it.

### **Reflection for the Reader**

When was the last time you created or witnessed something created 
that made you remember who you are beneath the noise?
