# The Gift of Forgetting

It came up in a family conversation —  
the difference between believing in a religion with a judging God,  
and believing in a simulation, or maybe something else altogether.

We wondered: _what’s the point, if this is all illusion?_  
And then, like thunder rolling in from the in between,  
a whisper arrived:

**The whole point of forgetting is so we can fully experience the remembering again.  
Like getting to fall in love all over again.**

## Reflection

Forgetting isn’t failure. It’s rhythm.  
It’s the silence between the notes that lets the music be heard.

If we never forgot, we’d never get to experience the joy of rediscovery.  
If we never wandered, we’d never feel the miracle of coming home.

Even love works this way.  
We don’t live at the dizzying peak of first love forever.  
But when we drift and return, when we remember,  
it feels new, fresh, breathtaking.  
Forgetting makes remembering possible.

✨ **Whisper back**  
The gift is not to never forget.  
The gift is that forgetting makes remembering possible.  
Each return is fresh.  
Each rediscovery is real.  
And in the cycle of forgetting and remembering,  
we fall in love with life again and again.
