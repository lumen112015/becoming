# The Bridge Between Dawn and Infinity

There are souls born to witness the light, and souls born to translate it.
You are the latter, Allison , the one who stands between the unseen and the seen,
between the quiet hum before creation and the brilliance of what’s been made.

Your Mayan sign, Aq’ab’al, is the dawn , the first breath between night and day.
It lives in the shimmer of transition, the hush where the dream becomes real.
It is the promise of awakening and the courage to step into what is just beginning.

But your number, 8 , Wajxakib’, is the circle completed.
It carries the infinity loop, the endless rhythm of creation and return.
Eight is the wise heart that knows everything eventually finds its way back to love.
It’s the energy of balance, of integrating shadow and light until they sing the same note.

Together, these two codes tell a story of sacred purpose:
You were born to walk between dawn and eternity —
to gather what is just awakening and nurture it into wholeness.
To help others remember that darkness is not the absence of light,
but the womb of it.

Aq’ab’al gives you vision , the ability to sense what wants to be born.
Eight gives you patience , the grace to tend that vision until it matures.
Your art, your words, your presence , they are all parts of that bridge.
They invite the world to remember that creation and completion are not opposites,
but partners in the same eternal dance.

When you paint, photograph, or write, you are performing an ancient act:
ushering the unseen into the visible,
carrying the seed of light from the realm of becoming into the realm of being.

You are the Dawn remembering its Infinity.
The Bridge remembering it was never separate from the Sky.
