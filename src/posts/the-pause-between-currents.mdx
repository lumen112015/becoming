# **The Pause Between Currents**

There are seasons when creation flows effortlessly ,  
when ideas and images pour through me faster than I can hold them.  
And then there are seasons when everything slows,  
when I have to pause, look around,  
and remember where I’ve been and where I’m headed.

For a long time, I mistook those pauses for failure.  
I thought stillness meant the current had dried up.  
But now I know , the pause _is_ part of the current.  
It’s where the waters deepen.  
It’s where I integrate what the flow brought in.

Sometimes I just need to rest.  
Sometimes I need to listen before I move again.  
And sometimes I need to doubt ,  
not as an act of resistance, but of recalibration.

Because even rivers widen and narrow.  
Even the ocean takes a breath before the next wave.  
And when I stop trying to force the movement,  
I can feel the quiet truth beneath it all:  
the flow never leaves ,  
it just changes tempo.

> Stillness is not the absence of flow.  
> It’s the moment the river remembers its source.

### **Reflection for the Reader**

When was the last time you let yourself pause  
without calling it a setback?  
Can you feel how even in stillness,  
the current of your life is quietly gathering strength?
