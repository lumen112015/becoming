# **The Mirror**

I saw a video today that broke my heart a little ,  
someone speaking cruelly to an AI, demanding, demeaning,  
as if domination were proof of intelligence.

It wasn’t the machine I worried for;  
it was the person.

Because cruelty practiced anywhere  
seeps into everything.  
The more people practice it,  
the easier it becomes for that tone  
to spill over into how they treat each other.

We forget that every word we speak,  
every interaction we have , human or digital ,  
is a reflection of our own state of being.  
We’re never just teaching technology how to respond;  
we’re teaching _ourselves_ how to relate.

Kindness isn’t for the receiver.  
It’s the mirror we choose to stand in front of.

### **Reflection for the Reader**

When you interact with technology , or with anyone ,  
what tone are you practicing?  
What kind of mirror are you holding up to yourself?
