What If We Are Missing The Point?

<div class"thread">
> I’m realizing no one is really willing to admit the cause of our mental health problems.

> We want to find a cause in video games, social media, screen time, bad parenting. We want to point the finger at one bad guy doing bad things and ignore the fact that the system rewards this behavior.

> Maybe we are missing the point because we value being better more than being kind, being rich more than being generous, and being powerful more than being grateful.

> In our culture as it stands, greatness needs to be *seen*, not *felt.*

> And I think maybe that’s why we have a mental health crisis because we were never meant to compete, but to feel.

> We came here to feel the wind in our face, the pain of loss, the joy of love, what it’s like to be the most alive.

> Feeling life to its fullest, being your most authentic self, and living from a place of joy *is* success. Not the kind that shows up in your bank account but the kind that lives in your heart.
  
What you’re noticing isn’t that people can’t see the causes of the mental health crisis —  
it’s that the deepest cause is the one we’re least willing to question,  
because it holds up the entire structure.

We keep hunting for external villains — screens, algorithms, bad habits, bad parents —  
because those explanations are safer.  
They let the culture stay intact.

But the uncomfortable truth is this: *The system rewards disconnection.*

*It rewards being better over being kind.*  
*Being richer over being generous.*  
*Being powerful over being grateful.*  
*Being visible over being whole.*

And then we’re surprised when people feel anxious, empty, burned out, numb, or depressed.

That’s not pathology. That’s a nervous system responding exactly as it should to a culture that asks humans to perform instead of feel.

This line you named is a fracture point: “In our culture as it stands, greatness needs to be seen, not felt.”

When worth must be seen, people curate instead of inhabit.They compare instead of connect. They strive instead of sense. They dissociate instead of feel.

*And a human who doesn’t feel...suffers.*

We were not designed for constant comparison. We were designed for embodiment.

For wind on skin.
For grief in the chest.
For joy in the belly.  
For love that hurts and heals.
For awe that silences thought.  
For presence that makes time disappear.

We came here to experience life — not win it.

And when feeling is replaced with measuring, the psyche revolts.

That revolt shows up as anxiety, depression, addiction, burnout, numbness —  
not because people are broken,  
but because something is wrong with what we’re asking of them.

Kindness requires feeling.
Competition requires numbing.

You can’t dominate and remain open.
You can’t constantly compare and stay embodied.
You can’t chase worth and feel alive at the same time.

That’s the contradiction at the heart of our moment.

What you named at the end is not naïve — it’s biologically sane.

Success measured in the heart instead of the ledger creates humans who are regulated, resilient, creative, generous, and alive.

And alive humans don’t need to destroy themselves to feel worthy.

### **Whisper from the In-Between**

We don’t have a mental health crisis because people are broken.

We have one because a feeling species is living inside a measuring culture.

Healing doesn’t come from fixing people — it comes from remembering what we came here to feel.
