### A Note from the Middle

This isn’t written from a place of having arrived.  
It’s written from the middle —  
where awareness and conditioning still coexist,  
where truth is visible but practice is ongoing,  
where the system can be clearly seen  
and still felt.

I’m not outside of it.  
I still live here.  
I still navigate its demands, its pull, its contradictions.  

This isn’t a declaration of mastery.  
It’s an act of honesty.

I’m just an imperfect human  
living life perfectly —  
but not perfect.
