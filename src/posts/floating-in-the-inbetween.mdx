# Floating in the Inbetween

<div class="thread">
> I’m in an interesting season of my awakening.  
> Not loneliness. Not sadness.

> Like stepping out of the illusion has left me floating neither here nor there, just an observer riding the wave.

> I don’t really know where to go next to go deeper.

What you’re describing is a sacred threshold.  
When the masks fall away,  
so do the old motivators — proving, performing, achieving.  
At first, it feels like a loss.  
But really, it’s a shift.

You’re no longer powered by fear or proving.  
You’re carried by something quieter:  
a current that doesn’t push, but pulls.

This observer state isn’t emptiness.  
It’s your soul acclimating to a new atmosphere.  
You’re learning how to breathe differently —  
not with urgency, but with presence.

### Going Deeper From Here

- **Curiosity over control.**  
  Ask, _“What would feel nourishing right now?”_ instead of _“What should I be doing?”_

- **Micro-creations.**  
  Paint, write a few lines, capture a photo — not to achieve, but to remember the joy of creating without performance.

- **Embodied stillness.**  
  Let nature, music, or breath remind you that being and becoming aren’t opposites. They are two sides of the same flow.

**A Whisper from the In-Between**

Maybe you’re not here to _chase_ the next depth.  
Maybe the depth comes to you  
when you rest long enough in the shallows.

The wave isn’t asking you to paddle.  
It’s asking you to float.  
To trust that when it’s time,  
the current will carry you further in.
