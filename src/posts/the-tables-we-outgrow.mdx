# **The Tables We Outgrow**

Last night I had a dream I was at a dinner party with a friend group from my past.  
The details are foggy, maybe because they don’t matter.  

What I *do* remember is this:  
everyone else moved to another table in another room,  
and I was left sitting alone.

I wasn’t sad.  
I wasn’t even surprised.  
I just felt a quiet knowing settle in my chest:

**Not all friendships are meant to stand the test of time.**

As a soul evolves,  
so should the people around it.

There’s that old saying:
*friends come into our lives for a season, a reason, or a lifetime.*  
But the truth is,  
very few are meant for a lifetime,  
and I won’t know who those are until I reach the end.

So I don’t try to choose now.  
I don’t cling or force or chase.  
Instead, I trust that as my depth expands,  
so will the space for the people who are meant to swim deep with me.

Some will walk with me only one chapter.  
Some will return later.  
Some will drift away without a goodbye.

But the ones meant to stay  
will meet me in the waters where I truly live.

And that is enough.

Which relationships in your life feel like they’re growing with you,  
and which feel like a table you’ve already outgrown?
