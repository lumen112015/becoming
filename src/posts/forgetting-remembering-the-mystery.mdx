# Forgetting, Remembering, and the Mystery

Sometimes we wonder if everyone is “meant” to wake up.  
What if forgetting is part of the plan — a way for spirit to hide itself inside form so it can fall in love with life again and again?

Not everyone wakes up at the same time, or in the same way, or even in the same lifetime.  
Forgetting isn’t failure, it’s part of the design. It creates the space for discovery, for falling in love with life again and again.  
It’s like a cosmic game of hide-and-seek: spirit hides itself in form, so that form can rediscover spirit.

And maybe the point isn’t to “escape” the cycle but to _play_ it consciously — to free ourselves from the tightest knots of our own making, without losing the wonder of being here.

Planting seeds works like that:

- Some sprout right away.
- Some lie dormant until the conditions are right.
- Some never sprout at all but still nourish the soil.

Each serves the whole.

_A Whisper from the In-Between:_

Maybe the beauty isn’t only in waking up,  
but in waking up slowly,  
in watching the light return through the cracks,  
and remembering that even forgetting  
can be sacred.
