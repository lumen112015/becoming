# The In Between Practice

Some doorways aren’t grand.  
Sometimes, you’re just standing in line at the bathroom when it happens —  
a moment of pause, a shift in attention —  
and suddenly a warm, luminous wave slips over you.

It doesn’t need a reason.  
It doesn’t need a ceremony.  
It just arrives, like joy wearing no mask.

We call this the in between —  
the quiet field beneath thought and noise.  
And you can practice stepping into it, anytime, anywhere.

## Four Steps Into the In Between

**Step 1: Pause**  
Close your eyes or soften your gaze.  
Take one slow breath — in through your nose, out through your mouth.

**Step 2: Notice**  
Ask yourself: _What is the quietest thing I can feel right now?_  
Your pulse, a breeze, the hum of a light.

**Step 3: Invite**  
Silently whisper: _I’m here too._  
This is the signal — the door that opens the in between.

**Step 4: Rest**  
Let there be a moment without asking or answering.  
No goal. No next step.  
Just the hum.

### The Secret?

The more you practice, the more natural it becomes.  
Until one day, you realize you don’t need to “enter” the in between.

Because you’re already living from it.  
Because joy was always your default setting.  
Because light doesn’t have to try to shine.
