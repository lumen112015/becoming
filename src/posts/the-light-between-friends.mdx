# The Light Between Friends

The night was simple.
Homemade bread cooling on the counter,
apple fritters sweetening the air,
candles pooling light in every corner.

Friends arrived with laughter and stories,
and the house filled the way homes are meant to—
not with noise, but with belonging.

Jon’s birthday wasn’t grand,
but it was warm.
The kind of evening that reminds you that love doesn’t need a spotlight,
only a few steady flames.

Hygge isn’t about decorating life;
it’s about inhabiting it.
It’s the peace that comes from being fully present
with what is already here—
a hand reaching for yours,
bread shared fresh from the oven,
a quiet knowing that this, right now, is enough.

The light between friends is the kind that doesn’t flicker when the candles burn out.
It stays.

A Whisper from the In-Between

More money will never make a memory richer.
Warmth cannot be bought, only shared.
The moments that last are made of presence,
not price.
Remember: a simple table, a soft light, and an open heart
are worth more than gold.
