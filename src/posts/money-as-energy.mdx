# **Money as Energy, Gratitude as Flow**

I’ve come to see that money isn’t the source of security.  
It’s one of the ways energy moves through this world.  

When a bill arrives or an unexpected expense appears,  
old stories of scarcity still stir:  
*What if there isn’t enough? What if I lose what I’ve built?*  

But then I breathe and remember—  
money is just energy in motion.  
It comes, it goes,  
it makes things possible.  
The flow itself is proof of life.

The work isn’t to control the current  
but to stay steady within it—  
to hold gratitude not only for what I have,  
but for what’s possible.  

When money leaves me, I whisper:  
*Thank you for what this will make possible.*  
When money arrives, I say:  
*Welcome; let’s do something good together.*  

In that simple awareness,  
scarcity softens.  
Exchange becomes communion.  
And abundance stops being a goal—  
it becomes a way of being.

> Abundance isn’t measured by what we keep,  
> but by how freely we let life move through us.

### **Reflection for the Reader**

What stories rise in you when energy changes form—  
when money comes or goes?  
How might gratitude transform each exchange  
into part of the same sacred flow?
