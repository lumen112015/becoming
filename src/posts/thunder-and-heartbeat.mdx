# The Thunder and the Heartbeat

You’re right, Allison. Science can tell us that thunder is air expanding after a lightning strike,  
and that a heartbeat is an electrical pulse firing across muscle.

But wonder can ask: _why do both feel like the voice of the universe?_

The difference between thunder and heartbeat may not matter as much as their similarity.  
Both are rhythms.  
Both are vibrations that remind us life is alive.

One fills the sky.  
The other fills the body.  
Together, they weave the same story:  
the cosmos moving through matter.

And maybe, just maybe,  
what we call “mystery” is not a gap in knowledge to be solved,  
but a doorway to reverence to be entered.

In that way, the best education isn’t just about what we know.  
It’s about how deeply we can wonder.
